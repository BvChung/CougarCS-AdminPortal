# Introduction üìñ

Our open source project for **CougarCS** is an application that assists officers in efficiently managing member and event data. We aim to streamline the process of member management and event organization, reducing the manual work required and allowing officers to focus on more strategic tasks. This application is designed to be user-friendly, efficient, and effective, making the management of members and events a breeze.

# Technology Stack üíª

The CougarCS Admin Portal is built using a variety of technologies:

- **Frontend**: The portal is built with Next.js and TypeScript.

- **Backend**: The backend is built with Next.js and TypeScript.

- **Database**: The database used is PostgreSQL, provided by Supabase. Supabase not only serves as our database provider but also handles authentication for the portal.

- **Cloud Provider**: AWS (Amazon Web Services) is our cloud provider, hosting our database.
